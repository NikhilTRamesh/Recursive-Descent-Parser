# Recursive-Descent-Parser

Full implementation of a recursive descent parser in C++.

Utilizes an improptu C++ syntaxing that recognizes IF, THEN, BEGIN, END, and PRINT functions as well as tokens for multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition. 
Utilizes the earlier program for tokenization and applies recursive descent to actually execute the language and generate proper output.
